we used Octave instead of MATLAB

the Octave basic Syntax Like python sometimes,but it used for math.

So the following are the special Syntax


1. []  means matrix,not a list

2. [1 2;3 4]  the space means same row,semicolon(;) means start the next row

3. you can use like this   A = [1 2 ; 3 4] then A is a matrix,you can access the value by A(2,2) it means 4 in this exampleï¼Œbut not like A[2,2] in python

4
